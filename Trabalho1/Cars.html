                    An automobile, nowadays more commonly known as a car, is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. 
                    Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to 
                    eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. However, 
                    in the beginning they were somewhat different.

                    The Benz Patent-Motorwagen (german for "motorcar"), engineered in 1885 by the German Karl Benz, 
                    is widely regarded as the world's first practical automobile, a self-propelled vehicle 
                    for carrying people, and first car put into series production.
